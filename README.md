# Reimagining Waste: Approache for Sustainable Waste
**Problem Statement:**

In industries today, managing waste effectively remains a significant challenge, with many organizations struggling to determine the potential for reusing or recycling waste materials. The waste generated often consists of a mix of materials, some of which can be transformed into valuable products, while others may be non-recyclable or require more complex processing methods. Without a clear and efficient way to classify waste and identify opportunities for reuse, industries are left with limited options for sustainable waste management.

Current waste management systems often lack the capability to assess the viability of transforming waste into renewable or usable products, leading to inefficient disposal practices, wasted resources, and environmental harm. This gap in decision-making leads to missed opportunities for resource recovery and circular economy practices, as well as increased costs for disposal and a negative environmental footprint.

**Objective:**

To develop an innovative solution that helps industries efficiently classify waste as either renewable (recyclable or reusable) or non-renewable (difficult to recycle or dispose of), using an AI-powered image recognition system. By allowing industry professionals to upload images of waste materials, this system will assess the potential for turning these materials into valuable products, guiding businesses towards more sustainable practices. The goal is to provide industries with actionable insights into waste management, enabling them to make informed decisions that reduce waste, maximize resource recovery, and promote sustainability in line with circular economy principles.
